            <p class="lead">
                In northern Vietnam, a colder climate limits the production and availability of spices. As a result, the foods there are often less spicy than those in other regions. There is less sugar and a whole lot fewer chillies in northern Vietnamese fare. Because of the north’s cooler climate, herbs and spices are not used as frequently as in the cookery of southern Vietnam. Black pepper is used in place of chilis as the most popular ingredient to produce spicy flavors. In general, northern Vietnamese cuisine is not bold in any particular taste — sweet, salty, spicy, bitter, or sour. Most northern Vietnamese foods feature light and balanced flavors that result from subtle combinations of many different flavoring ingredients.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                In addition, based on long-standing cultural traditions and personality of the northern people, food is also slightly subtle classical ritual. With the strict traditional principle, Northerners also bring perfectionism and stylish in their own dishes. Food are processed according to complex formulas, with adequate ingredients and spices, eye-catching and sophisticated presentation.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Being the cradle of Vietnamese civilization, northern Vietnam produces many signature dishes, such as Pho, Bun Rieu, Bun Cha, Banh Cuon, etc.

                            <span class="food-name">Banh Da Cua</span> uses an usual type of noodle called (as you probably guessed) banh da. It’s made from the same dough that’s used to make giant rice crackers. The noodles are chewier than other types of rice noodles, with more of a roasted rice flavour. The soup also contains pork balls, two different type of crab cake, pounded-up rice paddy crab and bò lá lốt, beef wrapped in betel leaves.
