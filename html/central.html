            <p class="lead">
                Differ from Northern people, the central habitants are gruff but outspoken, straightforward due to severe weather. Thus, central cuisine is notable for its bold and attraction, which sets it apart from austerity and complex dishes in the North.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Central Vietnam also boasts the country’s most complex and flavorful cuisine. The food is spicier with less Chinese influence than the north, while still retaining some of the French flavors and techniques that are popular towards the south of the country.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The region’s cuisine is also notable for its sophisticated meals consisting of many complex dishes served in small portions. Chili peppers and shrimp sauces are among the frequently used ingredients.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Coming to the centre of Vietnam, it’s regrettable to not try Tam Ky chicken rice or Cao Lau in Hoi An, Quang noodle in Da Nang and mussel dishes as well.

                        Hoi An was declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1999, and today it is a flourishing tourist center. Mustard yellow colonial buildings with vine covered terraces line dusty streets, and lanterns light up the old city at night. The delightful atmosphere alone makes Hoi An worth the visit, but perhaps the best reason to visit Hoi An is the food.

                        Hue food is a must when you visit the ancient capital of Vietnam. It is so easy to eat like a king here, but to understand the meaning behind the food, we need to go back in time a bit. Hue is affectionately known as the Imperial City of Vietnam until the year 1945. As the imperial city, Hue takes reign to some of the more delectable dishes throughout Vietnam dating back to the culinary cravings of Nguyen feudal lords, emperors and their hundreds of concubines and wives.

                                        The main ingredients of <span class="food-name">My Quang</span> are noodles, meat and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. Wide rice noodles are placed atop of a bed of fresh herbs in a bowl, and then warm or lukewarm broth and meat are added. The broth is usually strongly flavored and only a small amount of it is used, generally enough to partially cover the vegetables.

                                        Meats used in the dish may include one or more of the following: shrimp, pork, chicken, or even fish or beef. The broth is made by simmering the meat in water or bone broth for a more intense flavor, seasoned with fish sauce, black pepper, shallot and garlic. Turmeric is often added to the broth, giving it a yellowish color.
